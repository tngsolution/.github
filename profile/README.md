## 🚀 How It Works

GitHub automatically applies files from this `.github` repository to all organization repositories:

- When a contributor opens an issue, they see the issue templates
- Pull request templates appear when creating new PRs
- Community guidelines are referenced in various GitHub workflows
- Security policy is displayed in the security tab

Individual repositories can override these defaults by including their own versions of these files.
